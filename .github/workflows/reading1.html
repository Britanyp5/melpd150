   <h2> On photography In Plato's Cave by Susan Sontag </h2> 
   <p>   In the opening chapter of On Photography, Susan Sontag argues that “humankind lingers unregenerately in Plato’s cave,” still preferring images rather than a direct experience. Reading this in a world saturated with smartphones made her argument feel almost unrealistic because many people don't think this way anymore. When Sontag writes that “to photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed” and that “today everything exists to end in a photograph,” she is describing a habit that now shapes nearly every moment of daily life. For me, capturing images and creating graphics was at first never too important because I thought about how much storage it would take up and ill probably never look at the pictures again. Now I take photographs to remember, to share, and sometimes to prove that something happened. In class when I framed a shot, adjusted lighting,etc,it made me realize I am not just documenting reality — I am interpreting it. For instance when im taking a picture of my daughter doing something silly i now often turn or shift an angle to get the true nature and silliness of the moment. The camera does not simply record; it selects. I decide what enters the frame and what remains outside of it. In that sense, photography becomes a form of authorship.<p>
<p>    As a media maker working on multiple projects this semester for school and work, I am trying to acknowledge/see each assignment not as an isolated task but as part of a visual narrative about how I understand the world right now. Sontag mentions how photography has mended into something so simplistic that most can do (such as sex or dancing). Because many people can just take a picture, many don't find the art in it. For example, a photograph of someone illuminated by the glow of a tv screen in a dark room could capture both comfort and relaxation or scariness  and loneliness. With different factors when editing or taking a picture it can elevate more than that. \. Combining image and text could emphasize how language and imagery constantly shape one another.
<p>   Throughout these nine projects, I want to think of my work as a whole rather than pieces. Each piece can build on the previous one by exploring similar themes from different angles: how images mediate truth, how design influences emotion, and how repetition can create meaning (and practice lets me improve my skills).  Thinking about this class, if one project examines stillness, another might explore motion; if one focuses on documentary realism, another might experiment with abstraction.With this I can examine not only what I am showing but how I am showing it. Sontag’s warning about living in a cave of images challenges me to be more conscious of the power I hold as a creator. Rather than simply producing attractive visuals, I want my photography and graphics to ask questions: What is being shown? Who benefits from this representation? What remains unseen? By approaching each assignment as part of an evolving conversation about perception and reality, I can use image making not just to capture the world, but to critically engage with it. I think this class will convince me to get my own camera.
