  <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Britany Palaguachi, and I am a full-time student, 
    part-time worker, and 25/8 mother. Getting older and having 
    different experiences has made me rethink life itself — 
    to romanticize it and look deeper into it. I like dancing 
    Ecuadorian traditional dances, which has allowed me to 
    connect to my Ecuadorian roots.

    Going to college has opened my mind to different ways of thinking. 
    Helping run a restaurant has helped me understand the business 
    world and socialize with others. Being a mother has reinforced 
    my love for life because it reminds me every moment is precious.

    A good way of keeping those memories intact is taking pictures. 
    I used to hate taking pictures — I thought it was a waste of 
    storage on my phone. But now I pay for extra storage just to 
    capture everything my toddler does.
